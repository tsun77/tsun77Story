Hello, my name is Tianyao!

I have a dream of becoming a witch. To learn witchcraft, I need to go to Hogwarts. 
So, I found the Platform  9 and 4/3 and bang to it.

When I arrived in Hogwarts I met a girl named Susan, who was also studying witchcraft. We had a class together and we learned how to move objects across the room with our wands. We even learned how to turn silver into gold!

Though I had a good time in Hogwarts, I missed my family. My parents were muggles, but they were the best parents in the world. After graduation, I decided to go back to the muggle world and hided my magic in the real world.
